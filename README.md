Sometimes the transmitter in takes surge currents up to 0.2A!

Note:

The power consumption of this module is just around 12mA during transmission, which is even lower than a single LED. The operating voltage of the module is from 1.9 to 3.6V, but the good thing is that the other pins tolerate 5V logic, so we can easily connect it to an Arduino without using any logic level converters.
